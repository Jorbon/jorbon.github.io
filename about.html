            Hi, I'm a university student with a variety of technical and artistic hobbies. I study digital electronics, physics, and film and media in my undergrad degree program at the University of Kansas. Some of the coding projects in my portfolio can be found on this site as demos, while others that aren't browser-based are described in my project listings. Some of these are very involved in electronics hardware.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            My musical practices include guitar and piano, which I arrange and compose for occasionally. I also have working experience in lighting design for live shows, video production, and graphic design.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            This website is hosted on github pages, a static file-server platform. All of the HTML, scripting, and styling has been written by myself, including the background animations, which are inspired by my interest in physics simulations and emergent behavior.
        </p>
