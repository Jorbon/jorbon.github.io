            Hi, I'm a university student with a variety of technical and artistic hobbies. I study digital electronics, physics, and film and media in my undergrad degree program at the University of Kansas. Some of the programming projects in my portfolio can be found on the <a href="./demos.html">Demos</a> page of this site. Others are described in my project listings, including many that involve electronics hardware.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            My career focus is to create and work with technologies that use math for audio-visual media impact. To this end, I have experience with computer graphics, sound design, arranging and performing music, video production, and running live lighting shows. Whatever the application, I value tangible outcomes from my efforts.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            This website is hosted on github pages, a static file-server platform. All of the HTML, scripting, and styling has been written by myself, including the background animations, which are inspired by my interest in physics simulations and emergent behavior.
