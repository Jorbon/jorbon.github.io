            My undergraduate capstone project was building a portable digital camera from parts. I was the software lead, and wrote the firmware in C in an embedded Linux environment. Frameworks like V4L2 and OpenGL ES were central to the firmware, alongside obscure custom drivers for our display device.
        </p><p class="indent">
            I worked with three friends, who identified parts and designed the hardware and case. I worked closely with them to make sure we had the features we wanted with our limited resources, and to avoid compatibility problems. For example, captured photos can be saved to an external SD card, but only while WiFi is disabled since the SDIO interface shared resources with the wireless networking hardware.

            This is the first Minecraft mod that I have created, published, and maintained. The mod uses vector math and linear algebra to make the camera and controls of the flight system closer to real aviation physics. It does this by applying extra transoformation matrices to the camera while transforming inputs to different coordinate spaces. The repository has a handful of other contributors who have helped me add a configuration menu and keep the mod up to date with the game.

            This desktop application does a multithreaded scan of all files on the root directory and displays the file system as a tiered pie chart scaled by storage size. Files in folders cascade outwards so that relative file size is visible for all folder levels at once. The path and exact size of a file or folder can be seen by hovering over its slice. Clicking on a slice draws a new pie chart with that directory in the root position.
        </p><p class="indent">
            This application was developed in under two days to help find things taking up too much disk space. Performance and aesthetics were both difficult to achieve when drawing an entire file system. A culling algorithm working in polar coordinates identifies slices and levels that are off-screen, while groups of tiny sub-pixel slices are combined for drawing.

            This group semester project was made for my software engineering class at KU. We created an online calendar app that works like When2Meet, but makes it easier to schedule multiple meetings with the same group. Instead of communicating your availability separately for each event, you create an account with a single calendar, then join groups where members can see the overall availability of everyone in the group based on individual calendars.
        </p><p class="indent">
            The app centralizes data on a backend server, giving access using a REST API and requiring correct authentication to access private data. The front end is implemented as a TUI using ncurses. Significant challenges included dealing closely with time and calendar systems, and effectively coordinating work across the whole team.

            This is a 3D renderer that uses OpenGL shaders to implement both common graphics techniques and experimental artistic effects. Texturing, specular mapping, several variations of smoothed shadow mapping, a blinn-phong shading model, and a complex post-processing shader were all implemented. The post shader discretizes color channels to limit the color palette and uses a modified Sobel kernel to outline feature edges, both of which create a toon-like aesthetic that I want to use in a future project.

            I was preparing for a wiring repair on one of my guitars when I realized how many possibilities there are for custom pickup wiring. Specifically, there with 572 unique wiring configurations for a 2-humbucker setup. This project was an effort to make all of them easily accessible and enable experimentation with wiring.
        </p><p class="indent">
            I designed, modeled, and wired a tiny patch board to replace the electronics panel on the back of the guitar, so that I could use removable plugs to re-wire the pickups without tools or soldering. It worked as intended, but had some electrical connection and comfort issues because it was highly constrained in space and budget. Ultimately, I did my experimenting and then changed it back to a regular pickup switch, using the wirings that I liked the most.

            This was a HackKU 2023 project that myself and two friends created in 36 hours, winning first prize in the competition's general track. It takes the idea of a "wikipedia race" and makes it into a rogue-like dungeon crawler. It is intended to be a proof of concept in creative data re-interpretation.
        </p><p class="indent">
            Quite literally, it is a game engine that fetches a wikipedia page and then parses its content to procedurally build a dungeon level. Each section of the article becomes a room in a branching layout, while each hyperlink becomes an item found in the rooms. The link items are used to navigate to the article that they point to, which is used to generate a new level of the dungeon. As an aesthetic touch, rooms are also decorated with a random image from their section. In short, Wikidungeon is simultaneously one of the largest video game dungeons and one of the strangest web browsers ever created.
