            I was preparing for a wiring repair on one of my guitars when I realized how many possibilities there are for custom pickup wiring. Specifically, there with 572 unique wiring configurations for a 2-humbucker setup. This project was an effort to make all of them easily accessible and enable experimentation with wiring.
        </p><p class="indent">
            I designed, modeled, and wired a tiny patch board to replace the electronics panel on the back of the guitar, so that I could use removable plugs to re-wire the pickups without tools or soldering. It worked as intended, but had some electrical connection and comfort issues because it was highly constrained in space and budget. Ultimately, I did my experimenting and then changed it back to a regular pickup switch, using the wirings that I liked the most.

            This was a HackKU 2023 project that myself and two friends created in 36 hours, winning first prize in the competition's general track. It takes the idea of a "wikipedia race" and makes it into a rogue-like dungeon crawler. It is intended to be a proof of concept in creative data re-interpretation.

            Quite literally, it is a game engine that fetches a wikipedia page and then parses its content to procedurally build a dungeon level. Each section of the article becomes a room in a branching layout, while each hyperlink becomes an item found in the rooms. The link items are used to navigate to the article that they point to, which is used to generate a new level of the dungeon. As an aesthetic touch, rooms are also decorated with a random image from their section. In short, Wikidungeon is simultaneously one of the largest video game dungeons and one of the strangest web browsers ever created.

            In the spring of 2023 I conducted theory research on the Moire patterns of twisted 2D PdSe2 systems in my condensed matter research lab. I wrote software to visualize Moire patterns in large flakes, and I did mathematical analysis of the crystal geometries to derive equations for the Moire lattice parameters.

            This web app allows GMs/DMs to import images of game world maps and control what areas of the maps are visible to players. It is designed to make fog-of-war easy to manage with high-quality visuals, and has been used with success in sessions where I participated.
